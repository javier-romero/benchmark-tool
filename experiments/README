HOWTO
=====

Before starting, set the value of variable btool in do_benchmarks.sh
to the directory of the benchmark-tool.

For running clingo, only run-benchmark.xml has to be modified.

1. set in run-benchmark.xml:
   - configurations
     the $command with as first argument one instance file, and then the options
   - timeout, memory and parallel number of processors
   - instance directory
     * you can use dir_accept, dir_ignore, file_accept, and file_ignore
       with X_accept only Xs starting with the prefix will be accepted
       with X_ignore      Xs starting with the prefix will be ignored

2. set the $command and $options

3. run 
   do_benchmarks.sh name_of_the_experiments

4. Results will be stored in directory
     results/name_of_the_experiments

For running other systems, 
modify the $command and $options at run-benchmark.xml,
and modify solver.sh to call the intended system.
